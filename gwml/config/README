This directory contains my configuration (ie my ~/.gwml directory).
You can modify this file as a start to make your own configuration.
Most modifiable options can be found in Stdconfig (colors, font, etc ...).

NOTE: At start up, gwml will look for gwmlrc.cmo in

~/
~/.gwml-$(VERSION)
~/.gwml
etc ...

Try not to use the .gwml directory if you want to often change your gwml version, 
else problems may appear if your configuration files have not been updated.

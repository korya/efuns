If you are reading this file, you are probably looking for key-bindings.

Most key-bindings are defined in efuns/efuns/std_efunsrc.ml. Look at this
file to find general bindings, and modify it if you want. You can also
use a efunsrc.cmo file for this, placed in $HOME/.efuns/. Other keybindings
can be found at the end of efuns/efuns/{simple.ml, abbrevs.ml, complex.ml}.

 For mode specific bindings, take a look at the end of each mode file. For
Ocaml mode, the toplevel version (toplevel/ocaml_mode.mll) contains more
bindings than the dynlink one, and is more up-to-date. Why ? because I use
the toplevel version.

 Currently, menus can be configured through the {file_menu, edit_menu, 
help_menu, buffers_menu) cells. These are defined and used in the
efuns/efuns/top_window.ml module. Other menus can be added by
top_window.top_appli#add_menu or #add_button.
